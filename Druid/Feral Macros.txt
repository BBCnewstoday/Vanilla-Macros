Enrage + cancel buff

The spell Enrage causes you to take more damage but is really nice when tanking if you’ve specced into it in talents. In order for it to be useful while tanking you have to remove the buff quickly enough. This is annoying when you have to click the buff with your mouse to cancel. This can be done quickly in one macro where you press it once to cast, and second to cancel the buff.

/run local i=0 g=GetPlayerBuff while not (g(i) == -1) do if(strfind(GetPlayerBuffTexture(g(i)),"Ability_Druid_Enrage"))then CancelPlayerBuff(g(i)) end i=i+1 end CastSpellByName("Enrage")

 
Barkskin + cancel buff

The spell Barkskin reduces damage taken but increases casting speed. Its useful if you accidentally catch aggro but can be dangerous when you need to heal, its a tradeoff. This macro helps you quickly cancel it.

/run local i=0 g=GetPlayerBuff while not (g(i) == -1) do if(strfind(GetPlayerBuffTexture(g(i)),"Spell_Nature_StoneClawTotem"))then CancelPlayerBuff(g(i)) end i = i + 1; end; CastSpellByName("Barkskin")

 
Tiger’s Fury + Ravage combo spammable macro

This macro will prevent accidentally overwriting Tiger’s Fury if its already active and also if it is active, attempt to use Ravage.

/run i=0 m=0 c=CastSpellByName while not (GetPlayerBuff(i)==-1) do if (strfind(GetPlayerBuffTexture(GetPlayerBuff(i)),"Ability_Mount_JungleTiger")) then m=1 end i=i+1 end if m==0 then c("Tiger's Fury") else c("Ravage") end

 

If you only want the Tiger’s Fury spammable without ravage you can get this one instead:

/run i=0 m=0 c=CastSpellByName while not (GetPlayerBuff(i)==-1) do if (strfind(GetPlayerBuffTexture(GetPlayerBuff(i)),"Ability_Mount_JungleTiger")) then m=1 end i=i+1 end if m==0 then c("Tiger's Fury") end

 
Claw / Ferocious Bite spammable macro

This macro serves as a replacement for your claw ability. When you have 5 combo points on your target it will cast Ferocious bite instead.

/run if GetComboPoints()>=5 then CastSpellByName("Ferocious Bite") else CastSpellByName("Claw") end

 

Same as above but with auto targeting + auto attack.

/run if GetUnitName("target")==nil then TargetNearestEnemy() end if not IsCurrentAction(25) then UseAction(25) end if GetComboPoints()>=5 then CastSpellByName("Ferocious Bite") else CastSpellByName("Claw") end
